WHY ?

We know that the technology is changing fast and so are the devices used in Power Systems network. The hardware devices used in the sector are also having fast processing capacity and are intelligent. They also communicate data either periodically or on request or if some logic is met or at programmed intervals, to control centers or to local / zonal SCADA system.

 The devices could be Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) like Relay, BCU, Smart Meters, or Remote Terminal Units (RTU) etc. As these are electronic devices, they are prone to security threats. 

To make sure these devices are free from security threats, it is required to test them for malware / Trojan or alike of malicious codes present in the devices/ hardware systems (like System on Chip/ Microcontrollers / Microprocessors/ DSP /FPGA based products) which has inbuilt firmware and dedicated application programs running within available and constraint memory.
 
The challenge is to validate such electronic equipment for vulnerability assessment tests and for presence of suspicious or malicious codes present if any, in the devices; such codes could otherwise exploit specific attacks which may cause damage to process/ system or harm the environment and living beings on certain conditions or may trigger on logics including the zero day attack.

Modern IC designs often involve third-party intellectual property (IP) cores because of the high design complexity, the restriction of time-to-market and the cost constraint of final products. One of the challenges faced by the IP reuse-based design methodology is the untrustworthiness of the outsourced IPs. It is convinced that there are opportunities in which the IP cores contain malicious extra logic, namely Hardware Trojan (HT). HTs can cause the circuit failure or leak confidential information, which raise serious concerns about trustworthiness of ICs used in Internet of Things (IoT) and consumer electronics (CE) , as well as mission critical applications.

We proposeed a HT detection method based on structural features of Trojans and host
circuits. We extract a number of structural features of HTs from gate-level netlists and
construct a HT database covering the combinational logic HT features and sequential
logic HT features. Efficient feature analysis algorithms are developed to search small
piece of circuits which match the features in the database and are assigned with a
score. A score outlier determination algorithm is developed to identify suspicious Trojan
elements. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of
detecting all stealth Trojans from the benchmarks with short runtime and low false
positive rate, compared to the existing HT detection methods.
